          "answer": "During the forward bias of PN junction, the barrier potential effect is reduced and majority carriers cross the junction.

          "answer": "Both phenomena are different, in the case of the “photoelectric effect” to emit the electron, from the surface of a material, a minimum energy of threshold frequency is required.
